    "description": "This project was created for the Web of Things course at Artevelde University College in Ghent. During this course, a group of students accepted a challenge to compete with a team from Amsterdam and a team from Stuttgart. The goal was to use modern technology in an attempt to ease the parking process in big cities, which would lead to lowering CO2 emmissions and bettering traffic flow in city centers. This project is the result of a semester's worth of brainstorming, planning and programming.\n",
